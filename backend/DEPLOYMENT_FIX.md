# Deployment Fix for Rust Compilation Error

## Problem
The deployment fails with a Rust compilation error when trying to build `pydantic-core` (required by Pydantic v2) because the build environment has read-only file system restrictions.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Fix (Primary Solution)
The `render.yaml` has been updated to:
- Set `CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo` and `RUSTUP_HOME=/tmp/rustup` to use writable directories
- Use a custom build script (`build.sh`) that properly sets up the Rust environment

### 2. Build Script with Fallback
The `build.sh` script includes:
- Rust environment setup
- Fallback to alternative requirements file if main installation fails
- Force reinstall as last resort

### 3. Alternative Requirements File
`requirements-fallback.txt` uses Pydantic v1 which doesn't require Rust compilation.

### 4. Docker Alternative
A `Dockerfile` is provided as an alternative deployment method if Python environment continues to have issues.

## Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Python Environment (Recommended)
1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Deploy using the current `render.yaml` configuration
3. The build script will automatically handle Rust environment setup

### Method 2: Docker (If Method 1 fails)
1. In `render.yaml`, change `env: python` to `env: docker`
2. Comment out the `buildCommand` line
3. Redeploy

### Method 3: Manual Package Selection
If both methods fail:
1. Replace `requirements.txt` with `requirements-fallback.txt`
2. This uses Pydantic v1 which doesn't require Rust compilation
3. Note: You may need to update code that uses Pydantic v2 features

## Files Modified
- `render.yaml` - Updated build configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Added specific version pins
- `build.sh` - New build script with fallback logic
- `requirements-fallback.txt` - Alternative requirements without Rust dependencies
- `Dockerfile` - Docker-based deployment option

## Testing
To test locally before deployment:
```bash
# Test main requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test fallback requirements
pip install -r requirements-fallback.txt

# Test Docker build
docker build -t gmail-automation .
docker run -p 10000:10000 gmail-automation
```

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check Render build logs for specific error messages
2. Try the Docker deployment method
3. Consider using the fallback requirements file
4. Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Render dashboard
